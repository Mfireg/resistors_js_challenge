## Tools
#####  *Note: Depends on you operating system is how you should install the requirements, but here you have some tips.*

#### NVM
Sometimes could be a bit stressing to manage multiple versions of node so I suggest to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) 

#### Yarn
Here is where you can find [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable)

#### MongoDB
Linux users: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v3.0/administration/install-on-linux/)

Mac users: [Mac OS](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

Windows users: [Windows](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)

## How to run the project
##### Once You have all the requirements completed you just need to open a terminal, navigate to your cloned directory and run the next commands in the exact same order:

	yarn install
	yarn start

And that is all, if you want to verify the routes you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)
